(1) What are media qureies in CSS and their use cases?

Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics (such as screen size, device orientation, and so on).

Use cases:

Responsive web design, adjusting the layout and styles of a website to different screen sizes
Separate mobile, tablet, and desktop styles
Displaying different styles based on device orientation (landscape or portrait)
Creating print styles to format a page when printed
Applying specific styles based on screen resolution, device type, and more.

(2) Different between min-width and max midth in media queries in CSS ?

min-width and max-width are used in media queries in CSS to set the minimum and maximum width for which the associated styles should be applied.

min-width is used to set a minimum width limit for the viewport. When the viewport is narrower than the specified min-width, the styles associated with the media query are not applied.

max-width is used to set a maximum width limit for the viewport. When the viewport is wider than the specified max-width, the styles associated with the media query are not applied.

Example:

css

/* styles for viewports wider than 400px */
@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  /* styles here */
}

/* styles for viewports narrower than 700px */
@media only screen and (max-width: 700px) {
  /* styles here */
}

(3) Expalain float property and clear property in CSS with examples?

float property in CSS is used to specify how an element should float within its containing element. It allows text and inline elements to wrap around the floated element.

Example:

css

.image {
  float: right; /* other possible values: left, none */
}
clear property in CSS is used to specify if an element should not be next to a floating element. It helps to control the layout of a page by preventing elements from wrapping around floated elements.

Example:

css

.text {
  clear: both; /* other possible values: left, right, none */
}
